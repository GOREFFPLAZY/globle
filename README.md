# Meet gleezle!
### gleezle is an interactive geography guessing game inspired by Globle, designed for geography enthusiasts who love a challenge!

### Why gleezle?

gleezle was developed out of a love for geography and the desire to provide a more dynamic and engaging experience than existing geography games.
